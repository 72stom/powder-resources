# matrices
Resources which utilize features of Powder related to Matrices, including images.

There are around 2800 emojis in the 'images' folder, but only around 100 of them defined in powders.yml. If you'd like to define more of them, search for an emoji here: http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html and paste the unicode (without the U+). Flags and other similar emojis will have a dash between the two codes (for example 1f1e8-1f1f3 is China). Of course, the name of the emoji and the path name must be defined as well.

I haven't tested the existing Powders myself, so please let me know if there are any mistakes.
